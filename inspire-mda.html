<section>

    <h2>The INSPIRE Model-Driven Approach</h2>

    <p>INSPIRE is a directive about interoperability and accessibility of geospatial data related to the environment. <em>Interoperability</em>
        means that different systems are compatible and are able to exchange information, so that other systems will
        understand it. There are many different ways about how to achieve interoperability of computer systems, one
        of which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture" target="_blank">Model-Driven Architecture approach</a> (MDA).</p>

    <p>MDA defines a set of guidelines for structuring specifications expressed as models. Using the MDA methodology,
        system functionality is specified as a platform-independent model (PIM). By creating a common PIM, the INSPIRE
        community has achieved <em>conceptual interoperability</em> - we have created a common data specification. The PIM has
        been created using an appropriate Domain Specific Language. In INSPIRE and ISO, this language is the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language" target="_blank">Unified Modelling Language</a>
        (UML). UML is a language that can be used to describe all kinds of aspects of systems, be it organisations or
        software:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Static aspects such as data structure (Class and Component Diagrams)</li>
        <li>Dynamic aspects such as run-time behaviour or business processes (BPMN, Activity Diagram, Sequence Diagram)</li>
        <li>Relationships between people and software (Use Case Diagrams)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To achieve <em>operational interoperability</em>, the PIM is translated to one or more platform-specific models (PSMs),
        using an implementation language such as like Java, Python, or XML Schema. The translations between the PIM
        and PSMs are normally performed using automated tools, like model transformation tools. This is a core aspect:
        Ideally, we &laquo;only&raquo; have to agree on a conceptual model (PIM), and can generate interoperable PSMs -
        even for different platforms - automatically.</p>

    <p>For INSPIRE in particular, the MDA approach brought several advantages with it:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Consistent and well-structured approach across the teams working on all 34 themes</li>
        <li>Ability to model cross-theme relationships</li>
        <li>Effective re-use and detection of inconsistencies and errors</li>
        <li>Easy generation of encodings and other artifacts such as feature catalogues and mapping tables</li>
    </ul>
<h2><a name="inspireConceptualModeling" id="inspireConceptualModeling" href="#inspireConceptualModeling"></a>The INSPIRE conceptual modelling</h2>

    <p>To achieve semantic interoperability the conceptual modeling appraoch is followed. Conceptual modeling is the process of creating an abstract description of some portion of the real world and/or a set of related concepts. The abstract description of these realworl features is called a conceptual model.</p>
    
    <div style="margin: 20px"><img src="/images/xxx" alt="From reality to conceptual schema" title="From reality to conceptual schema" style="width: 60%;">
    </div>
        <p>The conceptual model is explicitly chosen to be independent of design or implementation concerns as is also the purpose for the model driven appraoch to support interoperability.. The aim of a conceptual model is to express the meaning of terms and concepts used by domain experts to discuss the problem, and to find the correct relationships between different concepts. The conceptual model attempts to clarify the meaning of various, usually ambiguous terms, and ensure that problems with different interpretations of the terms and concepts cannot occur. A conceptual model can be described using various notations. In UML notation, the conceptual model is often described with a class diagram in which classes represent concepts, associations represent relationships between concepts and role types of an association represent role types taken by instances of the modelled concepts in various situations.</p>

   <h2><a name="inspireUseCaseApproach" id="inspireUseCaseApproach" href="#inspireUseCaseApproach"></a>The INSPIRE use case approach</h2>

    <p>To achieve interoperability the stakeholders of INSPIRE play a key role. User-centered modeling is a process  based on understanding the needs of the stakeholders and the reasons why the model should be developed. 	 Use cases are used for this purpose. A use case is a written description of how users will perform certain tasks It outlines, from a user’s point of viewthese tasks and identifieds information needs. Each use case is represented as a sequence of simple steps, beginning with a user's goal and ending when that goal is fulfilled.
    <p>
        The creation of an INSPIRE data specification for each of the 33 themes followed these phases:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Organise a thematic working group</li>
        <li>Collect Use Cases</li>
        <li>Identify user requirements and Spatial Object types</li>
        <li>Determine required level of interoperability</li>
        <li>Perform as-is analysis and gap analysis</li>
        <li>Design a draft model</li>
        <li>Test the model and consult stakeholders</li>
        <li>Iterate over the model and feedback cycle</li>
        <li>After release, maintain the model</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="glossary" id="glossary" href="#glossary"></a>Glossary</h2>

    <p>This is an abbreviated and commented excerpt of the Terms given in the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>attribute</strong>: A single, simple or complex, named data element that is part of a class. Also
            called a <em>property</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>class</strong>: A description of a set of objects that share the same attributes, constraints, and
            semantics.</li>
        <li><strong>code list</strong>: An enumeration of fixed values. Such values are often codes instead of readable
            values, e.g. "1201" instead of "primary school", so a look-up table is needed for interpretation. Code Lists
            can often be extended with additional or more specific values.</li>
        <li><strong>conceptual schema</strong>: A formal description of a conceptual model, created using a conceptual
            schema language.</li>
        <li><strong>conceptual schema language</strong>: A formal language for the purpose of representing conceptual
            schemas. In INSPIRE and ISO 191xx, UML (Unified Modelling Language) is used.</li>
        <li><strong>constraint</strong>: TODO</li>
        <li><strong>data set</strong>: An identifiable collection of data, e.g. a set of files that each contain a
            feature collection.</li>
        <li><strong>data specification</strong>: A detailed description of a data set or data set series together with
            additional information that will enable it to be created, supplied to and used by another party. In INSPIRE,
            the term refers to a harmonised data specification for a theme adopted as an Implementing Rule.</li>
        <li><strong>feature</strong>: A (geographic) feature is an abstraction of a real world phenomenon. It's
            structure is defined in a class, the feature type. Also called <em>Spatial Object</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>feature type</strong>: A specific type of class that contains a location data structure, such as a
        bounding box or a polygon.</li>
        <li><strong>reference</strong>: A link or an association between different features.</li>
    </ul>
