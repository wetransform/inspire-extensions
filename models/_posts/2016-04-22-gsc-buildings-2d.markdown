An extended INSPIRE data model for 2D Buildings has been created in the frame of the [GeoSmartCity](http://www.geosmartcity.eu/) EU funded project.

It extends the INSPIRE BuildingsCore2D schema, re-using some elements of the INSPIRE BuildingExtended2D draft schema and adding new elements (FeatureTypes, DataTypes, Codelists, Associations) needed to match data modelling requirements collected in energy efficiency use cases.
